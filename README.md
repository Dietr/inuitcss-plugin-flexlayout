# InuitCSS plugin: flexlayout

A flexbox layout system object for the [InuitCSS](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss) framework.

Works as a drop-in replacement for the default `objects.layout.scss` layout object by using the same classes and variables.

## How to use
Replace the `objects.layout.scss` reference in your screen.scss file with `objects.flexlayout.scss`. Make sure that you put the correct path if you load this with NPM.
